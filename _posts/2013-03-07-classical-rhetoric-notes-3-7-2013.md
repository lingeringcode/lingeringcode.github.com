# Phaedrus

One must know kairos and how to grasp to be successful
Persuading is never simply persuading, but also teaching. Socrates, to Plato, embodies and enacts this method.

Plato's Socrates' critiques of writing:
- Writing is static; monologic
- Writing erodes capcity to remember
- Writing travels far, but the reader will most likely not know its original meaning
- Writing can make the fool appear as if he has wisdom

(273d-279c)


### ASIDE

Mentioned Derrida's *On Grammatology* & his other work that is a close reading of Plato's *Phaedrus*, which discusses what he calls a *phonocentrism*.

# Isocrates

Kairos alludes episteme
