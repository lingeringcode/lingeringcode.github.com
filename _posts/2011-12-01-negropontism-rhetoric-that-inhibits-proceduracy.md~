**Negropontisms and Rhetoric that inhibits proceduracy**

Negroponte's rhetoric has always called upon his work with Papert in
Senegal, as the go-to source for equating the naturalness of a child
learning how to walk and talk to learning how to learn on a computer. In
his TED Talks, during the initial rollout of the OLPC, he also boasts
that the XO/OLPC program will bring programming back to kids with three
new languages available for kids to explore. Yet, as I have learned more
and more on the [Sugar Labs team at
NDSU](http://fargoxo.wordpress.com/), kids don't naturally assume
programming and debugging skills that we are trying to instill via a
procedural literacy program at a local elementary school.

Take for instance, this video from the OLPC Australia. While I think the
affordances of this program are many, I can see Negroponte's deism, i.e.
the notion that the relationship between a child and an XO laptop will
naturally transmit deeper literacy skills, into the language of the
educators throughout the film. (NOTE: This particular topic will be
discussed on a greater scale in a collaborative chapter in *Writing
Posthumanism Writing*)

If you watched the video, you will also see the children working with
the activities that our Sugar team have deemed as being more popular,
expressive, but not as bent on procedural, programming skills:
[Speak](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Speak),
[Record](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Record), and one
educator even indicated word processing skills with
[Write](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Write). What I find
wrong here is the disconnect between Negroponte's naturalness rhetoric
toward programming, which gets subsumed by the more common perception of
essential computer literacy skills as word processing and working with
images, which is fine, but learning apps is not what's going to
guarantee any child a job; not unlike the American notion that getting a
Bachelor's degree will get every young adult a job.

Here's where I find the importance of OLPC programs like Uruguay, as
well as our own initiative at NDSU. Proceduracy, the ability to break
down complex processes into code, is the literacy that will take a child
far in the upcoming economy in getting a job, but more importantly, it
will grant them a higher sense of agency to navigate these multifarious
networks that have been created on- and offline. This is why we are
trying to [compose a curriculum](http://fargoxo.wordpress.com/syllabus/)
that doesn't assume proceduracy as a skill that comes naturally, but
instead as a literacy learned with a, as Dr. Brooks would say, longer,
slower burn of learning. This longer burn should be the goal versus the
short burst of intense engagement that you see in the above video. Yes,
that engagement is important, but how do we get educators to a place
where they can use it to produce a longer burn? My answer: drawn from
Latour (concept of *dingpolitik* and "Modes of Existence") dialogue
processes by which a network of people and the objects used create a
series of check points to construct the knowledge deemed necessary and
useful in theory and praxis.
