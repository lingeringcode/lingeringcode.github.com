Dialectic = Meta Hodus ("a way" "across"); it's about testing truth, yet another competition. And, in this culture, to have an art, you must have a method.

Plato's Gorgias is not the standard MO dialectic method. It is more Q&A, debunking procedure, or a type of surgery. At the end of the Gorgias, Socrates takes over, with Calc still angered by the dialogue, and goes into a monologue about the afterlife. It aims to expose UNtruths; it's about pretentions; its about each of them testing each other on what they think they know and what is superior.

Socrates' motives: What is it you teach? I don't want an *epideixis*. I want a straight answer about what is your art?

Plato: teaching is far different procedure and end than persuading
E. Schiappa argued that Plato invented the term Rhetorike, not Gorgias, as Plato was known for artifying his texts. It appears in Plato's Gorgias as a novelty.

Gorgias's def of rhetoric is at 452d-e in Plato's Gorgias. "It is the ability to persuade by speeches judges in the law court councilors in the council assemblymen in the assembly and in every other gathering whatsoever, when there is a political gathering"

Furthermore, to Gorgias, rhetoric is not about the construction of knowledge.

Socrates's response to this is at 453a: [add quote]

Socrates confronts G on what justice is. G says rhetoric has great power, and Socrates does not deny this, but presses him on what justice is in relation to rhetoric and its teaching. You say you can persuade in decision-making, but do you teach justice, Gorgias?

## Episteme and Persuasion
*Episteme* is about testing truths, connected to teaching. Episteme is only coming to know truth, which can also be knowing something as being false.

Persuasion is about coming to a held belief. Its consistency and compatibilty is generated through *doxa* (opinions/beliefs meant to be tested). 

*Peitho* = persuasion, also venerated as a god, to be in a state of belief;

*pistis* (proof, things worthy of belief)

## Other terms
*ochlos* (a mob)

fallacy: another way of using it was to described and known as a sophist method in the perjorative sense.
