Poulakos (1994) gives attention to the sophists in the Greek tradition, which, as he claims, has yet to be given proper attention in the "trilogy" (p.55) in the Greek experience of rhetoric; the other two being Plato's "idealism" and Aristotle's focus on "development."

The sophists practiced rhetoric and brought rhetoric to the forefront of Greek thought before rhetoric was a theory to reflect on. Relying on experimentation and poetic texts, sophists, as Poulakos claims, created the following parameters of rhetoric: "rhetoric as art (a *techne*), style as personal expression, *kairos* (the opportune moment), *to prepon* (the appropriate), and *to dynaton* (the possible)" (p. 56).

The medium of this *techne* was *logos*, "whose aim," suggests Poulakos, "is *terpsis* (aesthetic pleasure) and *pistis* (belief)."

He notes that their focus on style has been given plenty of attention, but implies that such attention has often been diminished by the claim this attention to style is about the "non-essential" (p. 57), despites Aristotle's reflection that "'the way a thing is said does affect its intelligibility," or affects its affect to produce desired effects. Sorry, I couldn't resist. :-)

## *kairos*
Poulakos then shifts his focus on how sophists were attuned to respond to situations and were keenly aware of the temporality of the situation. Accordingly, anything prepared would "betray our insensitivity to and insecurity about all that is contingent in the act of speaking" (p. 60). Well known sophists, such as Gorgias and Hippias value the speaker who "has no need for notes or a text, rehearsal, or presituational practice." This practice is not philosphical, though. Poulakos claims that it is more "observational," where "what is said is timely, its timeliness renders it more sensible, more rightful, and ultimately more persuasive" (p. 60). He notes that Protagoras was one of the first to recognize the importance of timeliness. Yet, *kairos* is not just about speech existing in time, but "constitutes a prompting toward speaking and a criterion of the value of speech" (p. 61).

## *to prepon*
*to prepon* complements *kairos* in that it indicates situations have conventions, and Gorgias was one sophist to emphasize the importance and role of an audience in argumentation. *to prepon* is concerned with the what that is delivered to an audience -- what is appropriate -- in a situation, which works in tandem with the when of *kairos*.

This relationship between *to prepon* and *kairos* gives rise to the quality of a message, making it "compatible with the audeince and the occasion" (p. 61). In this transaction Poulakos suggesets sophists saw the art of rhetoric as a type of transcaction between rhetor and audience, where the audience appreciates a rhetor who takes these things into account, thereby extending their gratitude and grace to listen to a rhetor's messages. For a sophist, expecations must be met, by some token of the sense, for persuasion to occur.
