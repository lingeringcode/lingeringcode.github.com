### Nick Briz's "Open Letter to Apple"

Be sure to watch Nick Briz's "[open letter to Apple + experimental prosumer manifesto](http://nickbriz.com/applecomputers/)." 

Briz and his fellow dirty new media artists discuss issues like "planned obsolescence, upgrade culture, technological self-reliance, control, and copying" through an exploration and reflection of "their love && hate relationship with the 'default art computer'."
