## The Sophists

Sophists were not a collective school or organized group, but known by their core principles. According to Pernot, most of their works are lost (p. 13). Yet we know that they advanced two main ideas in rhetoric: 1) questioned the existence of unchanging values, and 2) intelligible realities.

Pernot claims that sophists created the philosophic parameters, where "all standards are undermined here to the benefit of. Phenomalist and relativist conception of the world" (p. 13). They practiced a "situational ethics" dependent upon "'the critical moment' (*kairos*)..., where "justice and truth are constructed in the moment... in and through the discourse that gives them life."

Sophists were concerned interested in situations where truth had not yet been identified. Here, values and probabilities are paramount and axioms and formal logic are but stances to be contested.

Pernot writes that all sophists were teachers, and "they introduced a new type of instruction with an intellectual character" (p. 15) to Athenians already immersed in subjects such as "music, poetry, and physical exercise." Rhetoric was instructed, claims Pernot, as "simultaneously both subject and method" with the following goals in mind:

1. to be a clever speaker,
2. preparation for playing a role in private and public affairs,
3. development of intelligence, education of the citizen, and
4. teaching of politics.

One of the main instructional tools for sophists were in the form of an *epideixeis*, or a lecture.

### Gorgias

From antiquity, Gorgias is the only sophist whose work has survived.

Well known for his treatise: *On the Nonexistent or On Nature*, "which considers the concept of Being according to a demonstration" (p. 15-16). This demonstration employs the following three points:

1. Nothing is or exists;
2. If something does exist, this something cannot be apprehended by man;
If this something can be apprehended, it cannot be communicated.

## interesting ideas

Protagoras wrote a collection of contraries called the Antilogies. Also, an anonymous work Double Arguments (dissoi logoi).
