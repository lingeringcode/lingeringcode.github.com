In this short paper, I am responding to Gorgias' "On Not Being". In particular I am going to focus on how Gorgias seems to use the precursors to Cartesian-based formalized logic -- in this case, though, he uses contraries toward different ends; namely, to demonstrate and problematize the human ability to *know* and construct an ontological position on something in relation to how we attempt to communicate such knowing to an audience/ourselves. Yet, before I respond specifically to the text, I wish to review Pernot's exposition on the Sophists to establish some context.

Pernot claims that sophists created the philosophic parameters, where “all standards are undermined here to the benefit of. Phenomalist and relativist conception of the world” (p. 13). They practiced a “situational ethics” dependent upon “‘the critical moment’ (kairos)…, where “justice and truth are constructed in the moment… in and through the discourse that gives them life.” From this point, I also gather that Gorgias' concern with Being is not as much about reality, (which is the topic of much deliberation today), but moreso the hot topic of his time: truth and the existence of a big "T" truth.

Sophists were concerned interested in situations where truth had not yet been identified. Here, values and probabilities are paramount and axioms and formal logic are but stances to be contested. Gorgias is the exemplar of these points, as he is well known for criticizing ontological bases via his demonstrations of argumentation that embody the aforementioned situational ethics of the sophists. While Being is knowable, it cannot be communicatable to another seems to be his major concern. This ontological position, in effect, “makes language relative," claims Pernot, "by admitting that in the absence of a speech charged with truth, there exist discourses, multiple and variable” (p. 16). It's along these lines, where truth, through language, is relative that I wish to focus my response.

Gorgias begins his demonstration by constructed a contrary that essentially states that being and not being are reflexive, where "not being is *being*," (p. 207) but "being also is being," so the opposite is also true. Accordingly, he is left to conclude that the two states are either true or false, where true means that they are the same thing, while false suggests being/not being are both null and void.

Gorgias continues by claiming that this line of reasoning leads us to only potentialities of truth, where, "If there is anything, it is either unborn or born" (p. 207). He uses these concepts to prove how both "are impossible," so what follows is the reason that "it is impossible for there to be anything." At face value, taking these concepts literally, it is hard to decipher what Gorgias means by these proofs. Yet, I seem to recall Professor Graff talking about how Aristotle would later recognize Gorgias for many things, but one of which was his style and use of metaphor.

If this demonstration is about truth -- on it being *and* not being -- then I find Gorgias' proofs highly insightful with regards to his context, living in a time where the art of rhetoric and dialectic, led by Socrates, aimed for the revelation of Truth on each matter. Gorgias, in response to this type of rhetoric, seems to fold more complexity into account than Socrates' *modus operandi*.

Socrates, who is a master of the dialectic, sought truth and outwitted everyone with his one-on-one techne. Yet, his method did not scale well in the midst of a larger audience, where a rhetor must attempt to persuade the minds of many, which according to the lectures so far, we have learned was a competive venture to win the adherence of the majority. In Gorgias' mind, I read "On Not Being" as a speech that discusses the complexities of rhetor-audience relations, where truth is situational. 

He talks about truth as spatial, as something that moves, "is moved," and then ceases to "be continuous but would be divded and not in that [same] place" (p. 208).
