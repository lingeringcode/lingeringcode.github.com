## Sophist Turn

Happened in 1980s

Poulakos' works (mostly articles) were widely read
Also, see Susan Jarods (sp?) 1990s book
Also, see Mario Untersteiner's work, pulls in post-structuralist thinkers.

## Protagoras

Protagoras calls himself a sophists, a teacher who imparts this wisdom, and deserves to be paid for his teaching (at major watershed moment, where there is yet to be an established school and pay for school is rather novel for the time).

The term rhetorician is never used for Protagoras vs. Gorgias, who is, based on Plato's Gorgias (via Graff, in class)

Few, if any, of the young men asking for these sophists to teach them for money are Athenian. (via Graff, in class)

*arete*/*aretai*(plural)--translates as virtue or excellence, not in a personal, religious sense, but to Athenians it is external, empirical, observational; one that can be commented upon; virtues of the body.
