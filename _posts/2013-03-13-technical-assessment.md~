# Technical Assessment

Defines with Heideggerian approach

Teston & Graham's study examines Avastin
It passed initial BC clinical trials, but failed the Confirmatory trials that indicate its benefits for breast cancer; produced public outcry; FDA conducted a public hearing (2-day even in 2011)

Graham: "evidence-based medicine is evidence-based policy"
Talks about evolution of FDA; the practices become boiled down to "adequate and well-controlled investigations" randomized testing, test claims against empirical evidence; it's a stat-based discipline

Teston use "charter documents" to make decisions, which include "quantifiable endpoints"
1. Overall Survival
2. Disease-free survival
3. Objective Response rate
4. Complete Response
5. Progression-free survival
6. Symptom endpoints; here's the focus of the presentation.

Endpoint modeling becomes a key point in the process to deliberate on assessing the claims.

Issues that arise w/ data gathering
1. non-compliance, patient agency
2. reliability of the evidential source, i.e. validity of human responses over long period of time)
3. standards for PRO data collection; how many interviews, how many patients?
4. standardization of assessment criteria
5. discerning noise from data; is it asymptom of disease or symptom of drug toxicity?

**Big question to end on** How do we resist quantification with endpoint models?

##Singapore's quarantine practices

Examine domestic media coverage of Singapore's quarantine practices in SARS

Uses Vasek's 3-generation of human rights policies/protocols, which includes the state's responsibility to manage the human right to a healthy environment.

Used LexisNexis search and thematic coding
120 articles, 135 pgs of text to code

Lots of appeals to nationalism, community well-being, producing social stigmas, while gov quarantine practices were harsh and framed anyone who did not follow it were conducting criminal activity.
