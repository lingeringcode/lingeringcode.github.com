Haas, C., Takayoshi, P., Carr, B., Hudson, K., & Pollock, R. (2011). Young people’s everyday literacies: The language features of instant messaging. *Research in the Teaching of English, 45*, 378-404.

Haas et al examined writing and literacy practices in digital spaces outside of classroom environments, focusing on the language features of instant messaging (IM). The researchers collected a 32,000-word corpus, produced by 103 participants, who were mostly working or middle-class college students. Utilizing grounded theory methods, such as immersion in data, constant comparison, and collaborative research teams, they set out to create a taxonomy of the linguistic features in this IM setting. The researchers identified 15 features within the following 5 categories: punctuation, letters, words, dialect and metadiscursive markers. Their analysis reveals that the participants retrieved the immediacy of orality through these metadiscursive markers and paralinguistic features. Such features, argue the researchers, enable writers to convey the desired emotional affect and tone of their writing to their audience. They concluded the study by inviting future research on how newer technologies, such as mobile devices, are also shaping the features of written language. Additionally, they emphasized the importance for teachers to recognize how writing is evolving in these mediated spaces, so teachers can understand the students’ writing practices in their everyday lives, as well as better prepare them for other contexts and discourses.
