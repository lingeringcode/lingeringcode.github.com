# Prologue
In *The One Best System* (1974), Tyack "attempts to assess how the schools shaped, and were shaped by, the transformation of the United States into an urban-industrial nation" (p. 3). By taking a systemic approach to the issue of "'modernizing' forces" of the 20th century, and historicizing the bureaucratization of urban schools, he seeks to shift the focus off of fixing schools by fixing teachers and the students, who are caught within an achievement gap codified by the discourse communities of privilege.

The following is Tyack's list of "persistent problems and misconceptions" (p. 11) surrounding the approaches to solving issues within the American educational system:

- The search for the one best system has ill-served the pluralistic character of american society.
- Increasing bureaucratization of urban schools has often resulted in a displacement of goals and has often perpetuated positions and outworn practices rather than serving the clients, the children to be taught.
- Despite frequent good intentions and abundant rhetoric about "equal educational opportunity," schools have rarely taught the children of the poor effectively- and this failure has been systematic, not idiosyncratic.
- Talk about "keeping the schools out of politics" has often served to obscure actual alignments of power and patterns of privilege.
- Americans have often perpetuated social injustice by blaming the victim, particularly in the case of instituational racism.

Overall, his book seeks to illuminate the central misprision of America's fight to fix/villainize urban schools as the problem and primary source for social injustice an ineqaulity, and, instead, desires to reintepret this history to explore the more nuanced issues that still remain in the quest for the "one best system" today.
