Here's a copy of my annotated bibliography on spatial rhetorics in antiquity. It has yet to receive feedback, and includes a comprehensive summary of a small corpus of 9 articles and chapters related to Greek architecture and how rhetors 1) used these spaces rhetorically, and 2) how these spaces rhetorically affected them.

Feel free to download and use as a tool for your own inquiry, as well as drum up a conversation here about this topic.
