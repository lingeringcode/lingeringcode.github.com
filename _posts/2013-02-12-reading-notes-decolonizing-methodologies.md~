In this 2nd edition text, Linda Tuhiwai Smith seeks to call attention to the influence of imperialism upon Western researchers and knowledge construction of the "Other". She seeks to push beyond mere deconstruction of this long, complex history of research of indigenous peoples--the push and pull between modernist-postmodernist thought--by both calling attention to the assumptions informing Western research methodologies, but also enjoin modern research practices with new ways to ethically investigate Othered groups, helping such groups maintain their voice and cultural knowledges.

She first surveys the various meanings and uses of the terms imperialism, colonialism, and indigenous.

Going back to 15th century Europe, Smith claims that Imperialism is used in at least the 4 following ways:

1. imperialism as economic expansion -- used as a "system of control" to gain access and maintain possession of "markets and capital investments" (p. 22). "Colonialism facilitated this expansion," says Smith.
2. imperialism as the subjugation of 'others';
3. imperialism as an idea or spirit with many forms of realization; and
4. imperialism as a discursive field of knowledge. (p. 22)
